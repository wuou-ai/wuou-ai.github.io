Welcome to my academic website! Here, you will find information about my research, teaching, publications, and academic contributions. This site is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Feel free to explore and learn more about my work in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science.

Research Overview
======
My research focuses on **Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, exploring foundational theories, algorithms, and applications in data optimization, data synthesis, and security. Specifically, I investigate the following areas:

### Deep Learning Data Optimization and Explainability
I pioneer research in **data optimization**, aiming to establish it as a distinct subfield or paradigm within machine learning. This approach includes data-centric strategies such as resampling, augmentation, perturbation, weighting, and pruning. From both theoretical and empirical perspectives, I analyze the core principles of these algorithms and propose novel data optimization methods for deep learning. Additionally, I study the **explainability of deep learning components**, contributing to a better understanding of their inner workings.

### Data Synthesis and Data Poisoning
Current training data generation methods face limitations such as an overemphasis on regeneration rather than diagnosis, focusing on individual samples instead of global data quality, and prioritizing training over security. My research aims to build a comprehensive technical framework for high-quality training data generation, consisting of:  
1. **Multidimensional Data Perception**  
2. **Training Set Diagnosis**  
3. **Generation Strategy Design**  
4. **Specific Sample Generation**  
5. **Safety Evaluation and Defense**  

This framework ensures the reliability and security of generated data for general learning tasks.

### Intelligent Analysis of Text and Image Data  
I apply deep learning theories and algorithms to solve real-world problems in social and industrial contexts. These applications include:  
- High-throughput intelligent analysis of internet-based text and image data  
- Intelligent parsing of industrial control circuits  
- Visual analysis for business intelligence  

These technologies have been successfully implemented in over ten large and medium-sized enterprises.

A Data-Driven Personal Website
======
This website is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), a ready-to-fork GitHub Pages template for academic personal websites. It separates the content of the site (written in markdown files) from its design (written in HTML, CSS, and YAML), allowing for easy updates and customization. Each time new content is added, static HTML pages are automatically generated and hosted on GitHub's servers for free.  

Whether you're interested in my research, teaching, or academic service, I hope this website provides easy access to my work and contributions.
