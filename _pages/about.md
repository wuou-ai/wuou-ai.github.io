Welcome
======
Welcome to my academic homepage. My work focuses on foundational theories, novel algorithms, and practical applications in **Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. I am dedicated to advancing research in data optimization, data synthesis, and AI security, while also exploring their applications in real-world scenarios such as intelligent analysis of text and image data.

Research Overview
======
My research revolves around **Data-Centric AI**, with a strong emphasis on improving the quality, reliability, and security of data used in machine learning and artificial intelligence systems. Key areas of interest include:

### Deep Learning Data Optimization and Explainability
I am among the first to propose and systematically explore **data optimization** as a potential subfield or paradigm within machine learning. This research unifies various data-centric strategies, such as resampling, augmentation, perturbation, weighting, and pruning. I have developed new algorithms for deep learning data optimization and conducted rigorous studies on their theoretical underpinnings and practical effectiveness. Additionally, I investigate the **explainability of deep learning models and components** to enhance interpretability and trustworthiness.

### Data Synthesis and Data Poisoning
To address limitations in current training data generation methods—such as insufficient diagnostic capabilities, limited focus on global data quality, and inadequate attention to security—I aim to construct a comprehensive framework for generating high-quality training data. This framework includes:  
1. **Multidimensional Data Perception**  
2. **Training Set Diagnosis**  
3. **Generation Strategy Design**  
4. **Specific Sample Generation**  
5. **Data Safety Evaluation and Defense**  

This research seeks to ensure that generated data is not only effective for learning tasks but also secure and reliable against adversarial threats.

### Intelligent Analysis of Text and Image Data
I apply deep learning theories and methods to real-world challenges in both social and industrial domains. Specific applications include:  
- Intelligent understanding of high-throughput internet text and image data  
- Analysis and parsing of industrial control circuits  
- Visual analysis for business intelligence  

These methods have been successfully deployed in collaborations with over ten large and medium-sized enterprises, demonstrating the practical impact of my research.

Teaching and Mentorship
======
I am committed to cultivating the next generation of researchers and professionals in artificial intelligence and data science. I teach both core and elective courses at the undergraduate level, including:  
- **Introduction to Data Science** (Core course)  
- **Deep Learning** (Elective course)  

Additionally, I actively mentor students and young researchers, guiding them in their pursuit of knowledge and innovation in AI and machine learning.

Service and Leadership
======
My contributions to the academic community include:  
- Serving as a (Senior) Program Committee Member for **CCF A/B/C Conferences**  
- Reviewing for top-tier AI journals  
- Founding and leading the **Data Science Program** in the School of Mathematics at Tianjin University  

Through these efforts, I aim to advance the field of data-centric AI and contribute to the broader academic and industrial communities.
